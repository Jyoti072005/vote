# 🗳️ VotePoll Smart Contract

![VotePoll Demo](./Screenshot%202025-10-29%20141802.png)

## 📖 Project Description
**VotePoll** is a simple and secure decentralized voting system built on the Celo blockchain.  
It allows users to cast a single vote for their preferred candidate, ensuring transparency and fairness through smart contract logic.  

This project is designed to be beginner-friendly — perfect for learning the basics of Solidity, blockchain voting mechanisms, and deploying to a testnet like **Celo Sepolia**.

---

## 🚀 What It Does
VotePoll enables anyone to:
1. View a list of available candidates.
2. Cast **one vote per address**.
3. Retrieve vote counts for each candidate.
4. Check the **current winner** in real time.

All actions are recorded on-chain for transparency — no database, no intermediaries, just pure blockchain logic.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ **Fixed Candidate List:** Predefined candidates (“Alice”, “Bob”, “Charlie”) for simplicity.  
- 🔐 **One Vote Per User:** Prevents duplicate votes using address-based tracking.  
- 🧾 **Public Transparency:** All votes are visible on-chain.  
- 🏆 **Live Winner Tracking:** Instantly check who’s leading the poll.  
- 🌐 **Celo-Compatible:** Deployed on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet**.
